# Changelog — Slime Game

All notable changes to **Slime Game** will be documented in this file. We follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

---

## [0.2.1] — 2025-09-07 (AEST)
### Added
- Dependency documentation: `docs/dependencies/functions.md` (autogenerated function catalog from available scripts).
- Dependency documentation: `docs/dependencies/object-script-map.md` (skeleton map; to be filled as event code is scanned).

### Notes
- This is the starting point for a living dependency map. As more scripts/events are scanned, these docs will be extended.



## [0.2.0] — 2025-09-07 (AEST)
### Added
- Repository documentation: `docs/SLIME_GAME_REPO_INDEX.md` (grouped index + full file listing).
- Documentation plan: `docs/DEPENDENCY_MAP_PLAN.md` for mapping functions, object→script usage, and call graphs.
- Adopted the project name **“Slime Game”** consistently across documentation.

### Notes
- `filelist.txt` was added upstream to capture an authoritative file list; this index reflects that state.

## [0.1.0] — Initial import
### Added
- Initial GameMaker Studio 2 project structure (`Slime Game.yyp`, assets under `fonts/`, `objects/`, `rooms/`, `scripts/`, `sprites/`, `tilesets/`).
- Housekeeping: `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `README.md`.
