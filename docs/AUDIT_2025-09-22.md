# Audit Report â€” 2025-09-22

## Scope

Comprehensive review of dungeon generation, documentation, and object
architecture with emphasis on:

1. Documentation accuracy and maintenance workflow.
2. Alignment with GameMaker-recommended architectural patterns.
3. Object hierarchy health and extensibility.
4. Appropriate use of built-in GameMaker functionality.

## Findings & Changes

### Documentation
- Replaced stale manual tables with curated summaries that defer to the
  auto-generated HTML catalogue (`functions.html` and
  `object-script-map.html`).
- Documented the workflow for regenerating references via
  `npm run generate-docs`.
- Highlighted critical dungeon-generation helpers, including the new
  configuration validator.

### Dungeon Generator Configuration
- Added `dgConfigValidate()` to enforce numeric bounds, string
  requirements, and tileset existence before any tilemap is mutated.
- Introduced `dgConfigEnsureTilesetId()` so overrides can pass either
  asset ids or human-readable asset names.
- Hardened `dgLayerRequire()` to use tileset-derived dimensions instead of
  hard-coded values and to reuse the validation helper when binding the
  tileset.
- All generator entry points now call the validator, eliminating the
  undefined-attribute crashes previously observed in runtime.

### Object Hierarchy & Architecture
- Verified that gameplay families (`obj_enemy_*`, `obj_trigger_*`,
  pickups) inherit from shared parents to centralise behaviour.
- Documented these inheritance chains in the updated object map summary
  to guide future expansion.
- Confirmed controllers (`obj_game_controller`, `obj_menu_controller`) are
  responsible for bootstrapping systems, matching GameMaker's recommended
  division of responsibilities.

### Built-in Functionality Usage
- `dgLayerRequire()` now queries tile metrics via
  `tileset_get_tilewidth/height`, adhering to manual guidance for
  tilemap creation.
- Configuration validation uses `asset_get_index()` instead of hard-coded
  ids, improving compatibility with the IDE's asset management.
- Audit confirms collision and movement systems rely on GameMaker tilemap
  APIs rather than custom replacements.

## Recommendations
- Keep script headers descriptive so the documentation generator remains
  trustworthy.
- When introducing new config fields, extend `dgConfigValidate()` to
  enforce contracts up front.
- Regenerate docs as part of QA for any feature work touching scripts or
  object events.
